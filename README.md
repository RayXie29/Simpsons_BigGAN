# Simpsons GAN
**NOT FINISH YET**
<br />
This repo is the implementation of BigGAN and the training target is Simpsons faces in kaggle public dataset. Although the implementation refered to BigGAN, but there are still some modifications in order to have a better fit on Simpsons dataset. And this is still an on going project, since the training process of GAN is a brittle work. But the current results seems already done with 50% of work, which means you can tell the generated images are a little bit Simpsons-ly. I will keep updaing the result/code until the generated images are good to go. <br />

## Model

What original BigGAN do :
<br />
1. SA-GAN architecture
2. Hinge loss
3. Conditional batch normalization
4. Spectral normalization
5. Moving averages of generator's weights
6. Orthogonal initialization
7. Orthogonal regularization
8. Truncation trick

What I do:
<br />
1. SA-GAN architecture
2. Hingeloss
3. Spectral normalization
4. Orthogonal regularization
<br />
I think the conditional batch normalization could improve the results a lot, but unfortunately, the original dataset doesn't have categorical/class label. <br />

## Training recipe

Most of the hyper-parameters can refer to `project_config.py`, which is pretty much the current model setting. The total training epochs is around 1000 epochs, and the steps of each epoch is `total_epochs//batch_size`. Since the hardware limitation, so the biggest batch size I could use is `64`, and the image/generated image resolution is `(64,64,3)`. Both generator and discriminator are using Adam optimizer with learning rate `1e-4 for G and 2e-4 for D`, and `beta_1 = 0, beta_2 = 0.9` <br />
